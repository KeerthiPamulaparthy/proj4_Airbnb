Metis boot Camp Project 4: Airbnb listing recommendation by using NLP on textual reviews
For this project, I obtained listings and reviews data from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html for New York City.
I tokenized each sentence of a review and performed topic modeling, to get 20 topics. I then did dimensionality reduction using NMF,F
Based on the user input of key words, I would find a cosine similarity between user input and listings to recommend top listings for the user.
